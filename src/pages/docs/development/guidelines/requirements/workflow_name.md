All nf-core pipelines should be lower case and without punctuation.
This is to maximise compatibility with other platforms such as Docker Hub, which enforce such rules.
We prefer that they are descriptive towards the data or analysis type the pipeline will be using or performing, and should be approved by the nf-core community [(`#new-pipelines`)](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/CE6SDEDAA).
In documentation, please refer to your pipeline as `nf-core/yourpipeline`.
